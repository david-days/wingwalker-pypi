"""
Simple script demonstrating how to write out a wing request as a configuration file.

This is useful in several ways.  First, it allows you to save the initial request, in case it needs to be referenced at a later time
or reran.

Secondly, it can provide a baseline configuration for other requests; the saved file can be copied, edited, and made into an 
assembly of airfoils and control surfaces, to be called later for actual generation.
