# Wingwalker Python Module

This Python module provides core functions and scripts to create useful airfoil models
and files from engineering specifications.  These base models can then be used to 
create useful designs and implementations (VR and 3D models, 3D printer components, etc).

## Philosophy

Wing selection and design can be very complex.  From the choice of starting
airfoil specs (custom or existing), to cost analysis, and finally to construction, the spectrum of
both choices and pitfalls at each stage can become overwhelming pretty quickly, especially to 
someone whose primary interest is what comes _after_ the wings are bolted on. 

The goal behind this software is very straightforward:  To give everyone, from 
the basic hobbyist to the serious (semi)professional, the ability to go quickly from theory and
specs to design to real- or virtual-world production of airfoils and wings.
